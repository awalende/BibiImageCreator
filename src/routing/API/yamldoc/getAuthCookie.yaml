Authenticates a user with name and password.
Authenticates a user with name and password. You need to save the cookie response (in curl with "curl -c cookie.txt") and pass it everytime when you want to use an API Call from BibiCreator (in curl with "curl -b cookie.txt"). This server uses flask secure session-cookies for authentication. By not providing the authentication cookie in further api calls, the server will treat you as an unauthorized person.
