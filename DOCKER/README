This is a short guideline, on how to create an BibiCreator docker image and how to start it via docker.
----------------------------------

F: How do I create a new docker image with a Dockerfile?
A: Simply start the createDockerImage.sh script by using ./createDockerImage.sh
   It will automatically download the newest verison of BibiCreator, download packer and
   combines it to a new docker container called "bibicreator". Make tweaks to the script and
   the Dockerfile as you please.

F: I now have the docker image, what do I need to start BibiCreator in a container now?
A: There are a few steps you'll need to do first:

     1. Setup a mysql server and create a database called "bibicreator".

     2. BIBICreator uses a config file, located at: /etc/bibicreator/config.ini
        So you will need to mount a config file to this location in the container.
        (Alternativly you could also modify Dockerfile to copy your config.ini to /etc/bibicreator/)
        You can find a config_example.ini in mountpoints/configdirectory/config_example.in.

F: What is the mountpoints/ directory for?
A: This is for the startupScript.sh and mounts the config file directory and the backup directory directly
   to the bibicreator container on startup.

F: How do I start BibiCreater container?
A: Use the startUp.sh script (and modify if needed).
